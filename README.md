  ## Project Description
  This tutorial will explain the details of a specific regex. This regex (which is short for regular expression) is [a-z0-9_-]. This bracket expression will search for everything inside of the brackets. Inside the brackets we have a-z0-9 -, which we will break down for you here. The hyphens represent a range between letters or numbers, so a-z is referencing the whole of the alphabet a through the letter z. Notice how the letters used are lowercase? That means that we will be searching for letters that are lowercase while within that range. Next, we have 0-9, which references all numbers between 0-9, so anything that contains any lowercase letter or number from 1-9 will match this regex. Last, we have the hyphen and underscore. This represents any string that contains the special characters of either the dash(hyphen) or underscore.
